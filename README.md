Day 1: ML Basics & Data Prep Slay

📊 Description:
Start with ML basics, import libraries, and clean the dataset. Handle missing values, scale features, and split into train/test.

Day 2: Model Training & Eval Glow-Up

🤖 Description:
Pick a simple model (like Logistic Regression). Train it, then evaluate with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1.

Day 3: Advanced Models & Feature Hype

🔧 Description:
Try stronger models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or SVM. Also, check which features matter most for predictions.

Day 4: Optimization & Tuning Drip

⚡ Description:
Tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for max accuracy.

Day 5: Live Demo Clash & Portfolio Flex

🔥 Description:
Build a simple Streamlit app to demo your model. Show predictions for user input (like age, glucose, etc.)

✔️ Cleaned + prepped data
✔️ Trained & evaluated models
✔️ Tuned for best performance
✔️ A working web demo 🎉
